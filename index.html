            <p><span>***</span>Slap Ya Mama was named after an old southern saying, 
              when people from the south are desribing a food that is REALLY good, 
              the saying goes, “It’s so good it’ll make you slap your mama!”  It’s a 
              ridiculous saying and under no means is it okay to ACTUALLY SLAP YOUR MAMA.  
              Just make her one of these delicious recipes instead!  I also want to send a special
              thank you from this Mama's boy to mine for the family recipe book I got for Christmas this year.</p>
